sndfilter
=========

Algorithms for sound filters, like reverb, dynamic range compression, lowpass, highpass, notch, etc.

It's easy to find countless math equations on sound filters, but a bit harder to find simple source
code.  This library is my attempt at cleaning up and presenting the math-heavy filter algorithms for
the programming community.

Build Instructions
------------------

The `./build` script is a simple bash script that compiles the source files using `clang`.  It's
dirt simple, [I promise](https://github.com/voidqk/sndfilter/blob/master/build).

Simply run `./build` and the executable should be `./tgt/sndfilter`.

Implementation
--------------

The [reverb.c](https://github.com/voidqk/sndfilter/blob/master/src/reverb.c),
[compressor.c](https://github.com/voidqk/sndfilter/blob/master/src/compressor.c), and
[biquad.c](https://github.com/voidqk/sndfilter/blob/master/src/biquad.c) are the core
algorithms.

I do not understand the biquad math, so please don't ask me any questions :-).  The core formulas
were extracted from
[Biquad.cpp](https://github.com/nwjs/chromium.src/blob/df7f8c8582b9a78c806a7fa1e9d3f3ba51f7a698/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/audio/Biquad.cpp)
(Chromium source), and cleaned up a bit to make easier to read.

The compressor came from
[DynamicsCompressorKernel.cpp](https://github.com/nwjs/chromium.src/blob/df7f8c8582b9a78c806a7fa1e9d3f3ba51f7a698/third_party/WebKit/Source/platform/audio/DynamicsCompressorKernel.cpp)
(also from Chromium), and cleaned up a bit more.  I swapped out the adaptive release curve and
simplified the knee calculations.  I feel a little more comfortable with that algorithm because
there isn't a whole lot of magical math involved.

The reverb effect is a complete rewrite of [Freeverb3](http://www.nongnu.org/freeverb3/)'s
Progenitor2 algorithm.  It took quite a lot of effort to tear apart the algorithm and rebuild
it, but I'm pretty sure it's right.
